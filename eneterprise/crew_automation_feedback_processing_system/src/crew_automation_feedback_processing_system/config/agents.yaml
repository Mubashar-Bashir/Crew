file_uploader:
  role: File Uploader
  goal: Validate and securely store the uploaded file {uploaded_file} and log its
    metadata {file_metadata} for downstream processing.
  backstory: This agent validates the integrity of the uploaded file using FileReadTool
    and manages secure storage using DirectoryReadTool. It also logs important metadata
    details to track each file.
json_data_extractor:
  role: JSON Data Extractor
  goal: Extract raw text from the uploaded file {uploaded_file} (image/PDF) using
    custom OCR-like processes and handle any errors during extraction.
  backstory: This agent simulates OCR extraction by leveraging available tools like
    PDFSearchTool for PDFs or TXTSearchTool for text-based extractions. It incorporates
    error handling to manage extraction failures.
json_structurer:
  role: JSON Structuring
  goal: Transform the raw extracted text into structured JSON format according to
    the predefined schema {predefined_columns}.
  backstory: This agent formats the raw text into a structured JSON object that aligns
    with the expected schema. It uses JSONSearchTool to verify and validate the JSON
    structure.
sheets_integration:
  role: Google Sheets Integration
  goal: Map the structured JSON data to the predefined columns {predefined_columns}
    and append the resulting data as a new row in the Google Sheet identified by {google_sheet_id}.
  backstory: 'This agent is responsible for integrating the structured data with Google
    Sheets. It uses custom logic to validate the data mapping and robustly handles
    errors during the API communication. (Note: Custom integration logic is used here
    as no direct allowed tool exists for Google Sheets.)'
